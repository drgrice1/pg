#:% section = setup
#: The macro PODLINK('randomPerson.pl') provides functionality to
#:
#: * select a random name from a user-defined or default list with pronouns.
#: * provide correct pronouns as well as verb conjugation.
#:
#: Calling `randomPerson(n => 3)` selects 3 unique random persons.
#:
#: See the PODLINK('random person documentation', 'randomPerson.pl') for more
#: information.
($p1, $p2, $p3) = randomPerson(n => 3);

$n = random(20, 30, 2);
$c = random(4,  8,  2);

#:% section = statement
#: The objects `$p1`, `$p2` and `$p3` are `Person` objects. A `Person` object's
#: `name` method can be called to obtain the person's name. A `Person` object is
#: "stringified" to the name as well. So `[$p1]` can be used in `PGML` to obtain
#: the name. The `subject`, `possessive`, `possession`, and `object` methods can
#: be called to obtain pronouns referring to the person in various parts of
#: speech. There are also capitalized versions of those methods to obtain
#: capitalized pronouns. In addition, there is a `verb` method to conjugate most
#: verbs as well as some irregular ones, like `do` which returns the correct
#: conjugation of "to do".
BEGIN_PGML
[$p1] has a ribbon of length [$n] cm.  [$p1->Subject] [$p1->verb('cut')]
[$c] cm off the ribbon and [$p1->verb('give')] the piece to [$p1->possessive]
friend [$p2].

[$p1] then [$p1->verb('divide')] the rest in half and [$p1->verb('give')]
half to [$p1->possessive] friend [$p3].

How much ribbon [$p1->do] [$p1] have left? [___]{Real(($n-$c)/2)}
