#: This example shows how to get student input in the form of a graph (a line)
#: by using interactive graphing tools. Load the PODLINK('parserGraphTool.pl')

#:% section = setup
#: A cubic is created with 3 random zeros and a random y-intercept.
#:
#: The `GraphTool` method creates the graph tool object. The only argument is
#: the correct answer. This is a string that contains a list of objects that
#: the student will be expected to graph. Each object is a brace delimited list
#: of the attributes of the object. The first attribute in each list is the
#: type of object to be graphed, `line` in this case. What the remaining
#: attributes are depend on the type. For a line the second attribute is
#: whether the object is to be `solid` or `dashed`, and the remaining attributes
#: are two distinct points on the line.
#:
#: The `->with` method is then used to set options for the `GraphTool` object.
#: In this case the options that are set are:
#:
#: * `bBox`: This is an array reference of four values xmin, ymax, xmax, ymin
#: indicating the upper left and lower right corners of the visible graph.
#: * `availableTools`: This determines which tools will be available for the
#: student to use.
#:
#: There is a default checker for the GraphTool that will mark correct a
#: student answer that 'looks' like the correct one. For simple graphs,
#: the default should be sufficient. See PROBLINK('GraphToolCustomChecker.pg')
#: for an example of how to use a custom checker.

#:% section = solution
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Two points on the line are needed.  It could be put in slope-intercept form
which would give a [`y`]-intercept, and then a second point could be determined
from the slope.

Alternatively, the intercept form on the line is found by dividing both sides of
the equation by [`[$x0 * $y0]`] to get
[```\frac{x}{[$x0]} + \frac{y}{[$y0]} = 1.```]
Thus the [`x`]-intercept is the denominator of the fraction involving [`x`] or
[`[$x0]`] and the [`y`]-intercept is the denominator of the fraction involving
[`y`] or [`[$y0]`].

The solution is
[! the graph of the line through ([$x0],0) and (0,[$y0]) !]{$gt}
